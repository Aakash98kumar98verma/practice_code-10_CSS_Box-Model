     raised by his aunt and stepmother.</p>
<p class="groove">The childhood name of Gautam Buddha was Siddhartha. Later, he was named Gautam Buddha due to his birth

<p class="dotted">Siddhartha completed his education from Guru "Vishwamitra". Siddharth was kind and compassionate since
     childhood.</p>
<p class="dashed">He did not want to be the cause of anyone's grief. He used to lose himself in sports too, so that the
     loser does not feel sad.</p>
